# Hackiethon23
My submission for the 2023 HackMelbourne Hackiethon, a first-year friendly hackathon. Involved creating an algorithm to win Battleship to battle against other competitorsâ€™ algorithms.

Used a heatmap approach and Bayesian probability to guide ship targeting and increase hit rates.

Numpy library was used. Our final function for ShipLogic is in [battleship.py](http://battleship.py/).
